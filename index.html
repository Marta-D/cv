        <p>To Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him
            mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and
            predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion
            akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,
            were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He
            was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that
            the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a
            false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe
            and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for
            drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained
            reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
            adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might
            throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive
            instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not
            be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And
            yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene
            Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.</p>
